# Login Screen with CustomTkinter

This project demonstrates how to create a simple login screen using Python and CustomTkinter. CustomTkinter is an extension of the Tkinter library that provides custom styles and additional features for creating attractive graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

## Features

- **Attractive Graphical Interface:** Using CustomTkinter, the project provides a modern and user-friendly graphical user interface for the login screen.
  
- **Simple Authentication Logic:** The login screen includes basic authentication logic, where users can enter a username and password. Currently, authentication is done with fixed values ("admin" and "admin123"), but it can easily be extended to integrate with a real authentication system.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Installation of the CustomTkinter library, which can be done using the command `pip install customtkinter`.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Run the `login.py` script.
3. A login window will be displayed, where you can enter a username and password for authentication.
